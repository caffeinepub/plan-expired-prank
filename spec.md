## Implementation Plan
1. Create single-page React application with modern hero section
2. Implement modal component that:
   - Displays on page load with overlay
   - Shows "Oops! your plan has expired. Try again later." message
   - Has a functional X close button
   - Has darkened backdrop
3. Add scrollable content with professional layout
4. Add footer section at bottom with prank reveal text
5. Style with Tailwind CSS for modern, clean appearance

## UX Notes
- Modal should be prominent and convincing
- X button should be intuitive and easy to click
- Page should have enough content to require scrolling
- Footer reveal should be clear but positioned at the very bottom
- Overall aesthetic should look professional to make the prank more believable
